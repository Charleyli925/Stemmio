# Architecture Decision Records

<!-- adr-history-max: 0077 -->
<!-- adr-history-gaps: 0020 -->

This is the default reading path for decisions that still constrain PageRoot.
Historical and superseded decisions remain available from the archive index.

## Numbering notes

The repository has one historical gap, `0020`, which is intentionally never
reused. The four collisions found in the first curation pass were assigned
`0055` through `0058`; future ADRs must use the next number above `0077`.

## Reading guide

- Implementing a change: read the Living row that touches the subsystem.
- Investigating why a subsystem was built this way: use the historical archive.
- A superseded decision is context, not a current implementation contract.
